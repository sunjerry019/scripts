# scripts
Automate the little things

Here are a bunch of scripts that I use on my Arch Linux system. They are generally bash/sh scripts. I might add more in the future.

I mainly use this repo as backup, and to track the various scripts I use in my workflow. Some of the more used one are as follows:

```
maintain
recoveryDataDrive.sh
svgtopdf
```
